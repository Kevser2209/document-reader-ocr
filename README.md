# Document Reader – OCR & Image Processing

This project is an AI-based document detection and OCR system developed as my graduation project. The system automatically detects document areas in images and extracts text using advanced OCR technologies.

## Features
- Automatic document detection from images
- Text extraction with Tesseract OCR and EasyOCR
- Image preprocessing and contour detection
- Turkish language support
- Desktop GUI developed with PyQt5
- Batch image processing

## Technologies
- Python
- OpenCV
- Tesseract OCR
- EasyOCR
- PyQt5
- NumPy

## About the Project
The goal of this project is to extract structured data from different types of documents using artificial intelligence and computer vision techniques. 

During this project, I worked on:
- Image preprocessing and enhancement
- Edge and contour detection
- OCR model comparison
- Accuracy and performance improvement
- User interface development

## Future Improvements
- Deep learning-based document detection
- Model optimization
- Cloud deployment
- Integration with enterprise systems such as SAP
